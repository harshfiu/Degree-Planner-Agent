## 1. Introduction

DegreePlanner Agent is a privacy-first, AI-powered academic planning platform designed to assist university students in optimizing their degree trajectory. The system combines deterministic validation algorithms with generative AI capabilities to provide intelligent course scheduling, career alignment analysis, and personalized study support.

The platform distinguishes itself through its commitment to local AI inference. All AI processing occurs on the user's infrastructure via Ollama, ensuring complete data sovereignty. No student data is transmitted to external AI providers during runtime.

### 1.1 System Scope

The platform encompasses six core functional domains:

- **Study Planner**: Time-based academic schedule generation with conflict detection
- **Revision Practice Engine**: AI-generated question banks with self-assessment capabilities
- **Academic Tutor**: Topic-specific explanations derived from user-provided materials
- **AI Study Buddy**: Behavioral support system for motivation and study habit optimization
- **AI Interview Coach**: Voice-powered mock interview practice with real-time feedback
- **Authentication System**: Secure user identity management with persistent profiles

### 1.2 Technology Overview

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 | Server-rendered React application |
| Backend | FastAPI | Async Python REST API |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data persistence |
| AI Runtime | Ollama | Local LLM inference (dual-model routing) |
| Voice AI | VAPI | Real-time voice interview agents |
| Fast Model | qwen3:8b-q4_K_M | Primary structured output model |
| Reasoning Model | qwen3:8b-q4_K_M | Complex multi-step reasoning |
| Embed Model | nomic-embed-text | RAG document embeddings |
| Feature Control | FeatureGate | Per-page access control component |

## 2. Problem Statement

University students face significant cognitive overhead when planning their academic journey. The challenges include:

1. **Prerequisite Complexity**: Course dependency graphs create non-obvious scheduling constraints
2. **Workload Imbalance**: Poorly distributed semester loads lead to burnout
3. **Career Misalignment**: Course selections often fail to map to career objectives
4. **Revision Inefficiency**: Students lack structured self-assessment mechanisms
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Cloud-based AI platforms require sharing sensitive academic data

Traditional academic advising is resource-constrained and episodic. Students require persistent, on-demand guidance that respects data privacy while providing intelligent recommendations.

### 2.1 Target Users

- Undergraduate and graduate students at 4-year institutions
- Self-directed learners managing complex degree requirements
- Students in technical disciplines with dense prerequisite chains

### 2.2 Key Constraints

- No external API dependencies for AI inference during runtime
- Sub-second response time for non-AI operations
- Complete data isolation between users
- Support for intermittent connectivity (local-first architecture)

## 5. Component Overview

### 5.1 Frontend Components

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| FeatureGate | `/components/feature-gate.tsx` | Per-page feature flag gating (replaces AuthGuard) |
| AuthGuard | `/components/auth/` | Legacy component (superseded by FeatureGate) |
| Navbar | `/components/layout/` | Navigation, user context display |
| PracticePanel | `/components/revision/` | Question generation and self-test UI |
| PlannerGraph | `/app/graph/` | Interactive prerequisite visualization |
| StudyPlanner | `/app/study/` | Time-based schedule interface |
| InterviewPage | `/app/interview/` | Interview dashboard and session management |
| Agent | `/components/interview/` | VAPI voice agent for mock interviews |
| InterviewCard | `/components/interview/` | Interview session display cards |

**FeatureGate Design:** Each page is wrapped in `<FeatureGate featureKey="page_xxx">`. If the flag is disabled, a full-screen locked UI is shown with the flag key for diagnostics. The gate reads from the `useFeatureFlags()` context hook which fetches flags server-side.

### 5.2 Backend Routers

| Router | Prefix | Endpoints | Purpose |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| auth | `/api/auth` | 4 | User registration, login, session management |
| planner | `/api/planner` | 3 | Degree plan CRUD operations |
| practice | `/api/practice` | 2 | Question generation, answer evaluation |
| revision | `/api/revision` | 3 | Document analysis, topic extraction |
| ai | `/api/ai` | 4 | Plan analysis, career advice, explanations |
| courses | `/api/courses` | 4 | Course catalog operations |
| history | `/api/history` | 11 | Plan, document & test history management |
| flags | `/api/flags` | 2+ | Feature flag CRUD (admin & read) |
| manual_entry | `/api/manual-entry` | 2 | Transcript parsing |
| interview | `/api/interview` | 5 | Mock interview sessions, feedback |
| vapi | `/api/vapi` | 2 | VAPI voice agent integration |

**History Router Endpoints (expanded):**

|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/history` | GET | List saved plans |
| `/api/history` | POST | Save plan (accepts `ai_analysis` JSON) |
| `/api/history/{id}` | GET | Plan detail |
| `/api/history/{id}` | DELETE | Delete plan |
| `/api/history/reset-all-data` | DELETE | Wipe all user data and reset profile |
| `/api/history/documents` | GET | List uploaded documents |
| `/api/history/documents/{id}` | GET/DELETE | Document detail / deletion |
| `/api/history/tests` | GET | List test results |
| `/api/history/tests/{id}` | GET/DELETE | Test detail / deletion |

### 5.3 Service Layer

| Service | File | Methods | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|---------|
| OllamaService | `ollama_service.py` | 12+ | All AI inference operations (with `think` param) |
| ModelPipeline | `model_pipeline.py` | 4+ | Dual-model warmup, health checks |
| ModelRouter | `model_router.py` | 2 | Fast vs reasoning model routing logic |

**Thinking Mode Strategy:**

Qwen3 models support a `/think` reasoning chain that improves accuracy but adds significant latency. The system selectively disables it:

| Method | think | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| `analyze_plan` | False | Fast model path — thinking causes proxy timeouts |
| `generate_revision_strategy` | False | User-facing streaming response |
| `study_buddy_chat` | False | Low-latency conversational requirement |
| `get_profile_intelligence` | False | Chat interface expects direct reply |

### 7.4 Mode-Locking Implementation

The Practice Router implements strict mode separation to prevent answer leakage:

```python
# Question Generation
if request.mode == "self-test":
    # SECURITY: Answers stored server-side only
    _answer_store[session_id] = answer_map
    
    # SECURITY: Strip answers from client response
    for question in questions:
        question.correct_answer = None
        question.explanation = None

# Answer Evaluation
stored_answers = _answer_store.get(request.session_id, {})
if not stored_answers:
    raise HTTPException(404, "Session not found")  # Prevents guessing

# Cleanup after evaluation
if request.session_id in _answer_store:
    del _answer_store[request.session_id]  # One-time use
```

This design ensures:
1. Clients in self-test mode NEVER receive correct answers
2. Answers are only accessible server-side during evaluation
3. Sessions are invalidated after single evaluation
4. Session IDs are UUIDs (non-guessable)

### 7.5 Authentication Flow Implementation

│   └── Yields database session, commits on success, rollbacks on error
│

### 9.3 Design Rationale

**Why TestResult Persistence?**

1. **Learning Analytics**: Enables tracking performance over time
2. **Progress Visualization**: Users can review historical attempts
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Future enhancement for smart review scheduling
4. **Accountability**: Provides evidence of study activity

**Why JSON Fields?**

1. **Flexibility**: Goals and preferences evolve without schema migration
2. **Atomicity**: Complete question sets stored as single unit
3. **Query Efficiency**: Avoid complex joins for hierarchical data

**Why UUID for TestResults?**

1. **Stateless Generation**: No database round-trip for ID creation
2. **Security**: Non-enumerable (prevents ID guessing attacks)
3. **Future Sharding**: Enables horizontal partitioning

## 10. AI System Design

### 10.1 Architecture Philosophy

The AI layer is designed around three core principles:

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature has dedicated prompt templates and output schemas
2. **Strict Scoping**: AI responses are constrained to provided context only
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses exist for all AI failures

### 10.2 Why Feature-Separated AI Responsibilities

```
INCORRECT: Single "super-prompt" for all features
  - Prompt confusion across domains
  - Inconsistent output formats
  - Harder to debug and tune

CORRECT: Feature-specific prompts
  +------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
  | Plan Analysis    |     | Question Gen     |     | Answer Eval      |
  | Prompt Template  |     | Prompt Template  |     | Prompt Template  |
  +------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
          |                        |                        |
          v                        v                        v
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                    OllamaService._call_ollama()              |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
                                   |
                                   v
                          [llama3.1:8b Model]
```

**Benefits:**
- Each prompt is optimized for its specific task
- Output parsing is tailored per feature
- Failures are isolated (question gen failure does not affect plan analysis)
- Easier A/B testing of prompt variations

### 10.3 Prompt Structure (Conceptual)

All prompts follow a consistent structure:

```
[ROLE DEFINITION]
You are an {expert type} with {specific expertise}.

[TASK DESCRIPTION]
Your task is to {specific action}.

[CONTEXT]
{User-provided data - notes, plans, answers}

[CONSTRAINTS]
- ONLY use information from the provided context
- Do NOT invent facts not present in the input
- {Feature-specific constraints}

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this format:
{schema definition}
```

### 10.4 Hallucination Prevention

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Context Binding | All prompts explicitly state "ONLY use provided material" |
| Input Truncation | Large inputs are truncated to 4000 characters |
| Schema Enforcement | Strict JSON output format with required fields |
| Fallback Defaults | If AI output fails parsing, use domain-appropriate defaults |
| Temperature Control | Low temperature (0.3-0.4) reduces randomness |
| Explicit Prohibitions | Prompts state "Do NOT invent facts not present" |

### 10.5 Evaluation System Design

The evaluation system uses AI for semantic grading:

```
Input: {question_id, user_answer, correct_answer}

Evaluation Prompt:
  - Define scoring rubric by question type
  - MCQ: Binary (correct/incorrect)
  - Short Answer: 0/1/2 (wrong/partial/correct)
  - Long Answer: 0-5 scale with rubric

AI Processing:
  - Compare semantic meaning, not exact string match

### 10.6 Why qwen3:8b-q4_K_M is Sufficient

| Requirement | qwen3:8b-q4_K_M Capability |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| JSON Output | Native instruction following |
| Context Window | 8192+ tokens (adequate for single topic) |
| Reasoning | Strong for educational Q&A |
| Latency | Sub-30s on RTX 4060 8GB (think=False) |
| Memory | Fits in 8GB VRAM quantized |
| Accuracy | Strong for formative assessment |
| Think Mode | `/think` available for complex reasoning |

**Why Not Larger Models?**
- 13B+ models exceed typical consumer GPU memory
- Marginal accuracy improvement not justified for educational use
- Latency increases significantly

### 10.7 Dual-Model Architecture

```

### 10.7 Why Antigravity is NOT Used in Runtime

Antigravity (external AI service) was used exclusively for:
- Generating this System Design document
- Development-time code assistance

It is explicitly excluded from runtime because:
1. **Privacy Commitment**: No student data leaves the local environment
2. **Latency**: External API calls add network overhead
3. **Cost**: Per-token pricing is prohibitive for high-volume use
4. **Availability**: Local inference works offline

## 11. Security and Privacy Considerations

### 11.1 Authentication Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Password Hashing | bcrypt with default work factor |
| Token Format | JWT with HS256 signing |
| Token Expiry | Configurable (default 24 hours) |
| Token Storage | Client-side localStorage (frontend) |
| Transport Security | HTTPS enforced in production |

### 11.2 Authorization Model

```
Authorization Check Flow:
  1. Extract Bearer token from Authorization header
  2. Decode and verify JWT signature
  3. Check token expiration
  4. Query user by email from payload
  5. If any step fails: 401 Unauthorized

Resource Isolation:
  - All database queries filter by user_id
  - User A cannot access User B's plans or test results
  - No admin endpoints (single-tenant design)
```

### 11.3 Data Privacy Architecture

```
+---------------------------+
|    Student Browser        |
+---------------------------+
            |
            | HTTPS (encrypted)
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
|    Backend Server         |
|    (runs locally)         |
+---------------------------+
            |
            | HTTP (localhost only)
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
|    Ollama Server          |
|    (localhost:11434)      |
+---------------------------+
            |
            | (no external calls)
            |
            v
+---------------------------+
|    LLM Model              |
|    (local weights)        |
+---------------------------+
```

**Privacy Guarantees:**
1. No transcript data transmitted externally
2. AI context is ephemeral (discarded after response)
3. Model runs entirely on local hardware
4. No telemetry or analytics collection

### 11.4 Answer Leak Prevention

The self-test mode implements defense-in-depth:

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| API Response | Answers stripped before serialization |
| Client State | Frontend never receives correct answers |
| Session Management | Answers stored server-side by UUID |
| Session Cleanup | Answers deleted after single evaluation |
| Session ID | UUIDv4 (cryptographically random) |

---

## 12. Scalability and Extensibility

### 12.1 Current Bottlenecks

| Component | Bottleneck | Impact |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| AI Inference | Single Ollama instance | Sequential request processing |
| Answer Store | In-memory dict | Lost on server restart |
| Database | Single PostgreSQL | Adequate for single-node |

### 12.2 Scaling Strategies

**Horizontal Scaling (Web Tier)**
```
                    +------------------+
                    |   Load Balancer  |
                    +------------------+
                           |
          +----------------+----------------+
          |                |                |
          v                v                v
    +---------+      +---------+      +---------+
    | FastAPI |      | FastAPI |      | FastAPI |
    |   #1    |      |   #2    |      |   #3    |
    +---------+      +---------+      +---------+
          |                |                |
          +----------------+----------------+
                           |
                    +------------------+
                    |   PostgreSQL     |
                    +------------------+
```

**AI Layer Scaling**
```
Option A: Request Queue
  - Redis queue for AI requests
  - Worker pool for Ollama instances
  - Async response delivery

Option B: Multiple Ollama Instances
  - One Ollama per GPU
  - Load balancer distributes by availability
```

### 12.3 Extensibility Points

| Extension Point | Mechanism |
|-----------------|-----------|
| New Question Types | Add handler in OllamaService.generate_practice_questions() |
| New AI Features | Add method to OllamaService, create router endpoint |
| External Integrations | Add new router under /api/integrations/ |
| Authentication Providers | Add handler in social_login endpoint |
| Database Migrations | Alembic migration scripts |

---

## 13. Failure Scenarios and Edge Cases

### 13.1 AI Inference Failures

| Failure Mode | Detection | Recovery |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Ollama not running | ConnectError | Return user-friendly error message |
| Model timeout | TimeoutException (180s) | Return partial results or retry prompt |
| Invalid JSON output | JSONDecodeError | Apply fallback defaults |
| Empty response | Null check | Return predefined fallback |

**Fallback Example (Plan Analysis)**
```python
if not parsed:
    return {
        "explanation": "Analysis unavailable. Please ensure Ollama is running.",
        "strengths": ["Balanced course load"],
        "suggestions": ["Consider adding electives"],
        "career_alignment_score": 70
    }
```

### 13.2 Authentication Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Expired token | 401 response, frontend redirects to login |
| Invalid token signature | 401 response |
| Deleted user tries to access | 401 response (user query fails) |
| Concurrent profile updates | Database transaction isolation |

### 13.3 Practice Session Edge Cases

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Evaluate with unknown session_id | 404 "Session not found" |
| Re-evaluate same session | 404 (answers deleted after first eval) |
| Empty answers submitted | 400 "No answers provided" |
| Server restart during session | Sessions lost (in-memory store) |

### 13.4 Database Failures

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Connection pool exhausted | 500 error, client retries |
| Constraint violation | 400 with descriptive message |
| Transaction timeout | Rollback, retry guidance |

## 14. Trade-offs and Design Decisions

### 14.1 Local AI vs Cloud AI

| Factor | Local (Chosen) | Cloud |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Privacy | Complete data sovereignty | Data transmitted externally |
| Latency | Consistent (~30s) | Variable (network dependent) |
| Cost | One-time GPU investment | Per-token ongoing cost |
| Quality | Good (8B model) | Better (larger models available) |
| Offline Support | Yes | No |
| Maintenance | User manages Ollama | Managed service |

**Decision: Local AI** - Privacy is a non-negotiable requirement for academic data.

### 14.2 In-Memory Answer Store vs Redis

| Factor | In-Memory (Chosen) | Redis |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Latency | Fastest | Fast |
| Complexity | None | Requires Redis deployment |
| Persistence | Lost on restart | Survives restart |
| Scalability | Single-node only | Multi-node ready |

**Decision: In-Memory** - Acceptable for MVP; self-test sessions are short-lived.

### 14.3 Monolithic Backend vs Microservices

| Factor | Monolith (Chosen) | Microservices |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Development Speed | Fast | Slow (more boilerplate) |
| Deployment | Single container | Multiple containers |
| Debugging | Simple stack traces | Distributed tracing needed |
| Scaling | Vertical only | Horizontal per service |

**Decision: Monolith** - Team size and scope do not justify microservice complexity.

### 14.4 SQLAlchemy ORM vs Raw SQL

| Factor | ORM (Chosen) | Raw SQL |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| Type Safety | Strong | None |
| Migration Support | Alembic integration | Manual scripts |
| Query Flexibility | Limited for complex queries | Full SQL power |
| Performance | Slight overhead | Optimal |

**Decision: ORM** - Developer productivity outweighs marginal performance cost.

### 14.5 JWT vs Session-Based Auth

| Factor | JWT (Chosen) | Sessions |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Statelessness | Yes | No (requires session store) |
| Cross-Origin Support | Native | Requires cookies/CSRF handling |
| Token Revocation | Difficult | Easy |
| Payload Size | Larger (contains claims) | Smaller (session ID only) |

**Decision: JWT** - Statelessness simplifies architecture; revocation handled by short expiry.
