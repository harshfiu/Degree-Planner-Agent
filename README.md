## 1. Project Overview

Degree Planner Agent is a full-stack web application that helps university students plan their academic trajectory. It combines deterministic scheduling algorithms with local AI inference to provide course recommendations, career alignment analysis, and self-assessment tools.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Generate valid semester-by-semester degree plans
- Analyze plans for career alignment and workload balance, with full AI analysis persisted to history
- Practice and self-test on study materials with AI-generated questions
- Receive AI-powered explanations of academic topics
- Track test performance over time
- Feature-flag gated access control for all major pages

**Key Constraint:** All AI processing happens locally via Ollama. No student data is transmitted to external AI providers.

**Performance Model:** The system uses a dual-model routing strategy — a fast model (`qwen3:8b-q4_K_M`) for low-latency structured tasks and a reasoning model for complex multi-step analysis. Thinking mode (`/think`) is selectively disabled on latency-critical endpoints.

---

## 2. Why This Project Exists

University degree planning presents several challenges:

1. **Prerequisite Complexity** - Course dependencies form directed graphs that are difficult to navigate manually
2. **Workload Distribution** - Poor semester balance leads to burnout or delayed graduation
3. **Career Alignment** - Students often realize too late that their course selection does not match career objectives
4. **Privacy Concerns** - Cloud-based AI tools require sharing sensitive academic information
5. **Passive Learning** - Traditional study methods lack active recall and self-assessment

This project addresses these problems with:
- Graph algorithms for prerequisite validation
- AI analysis for career and workload insights
- Local LLM inference for complete data privacy
- A built-in practice and self-test engine

---

## 3. Key Features

### Study Planner

---

## 5. AI System Overview

### Why AI is Split by Feature

Each feature has dedicated prompt templates and output schemas. This design:
- Optimizes prompts for specific tasks
- Enables tailored output parsing per feature
- Isolates failures (question generation failure does not affect plan analysis)
- Allows independent tuning and testing

### Dual-Model Routing

The system routes requests between two models based on task requirements:

| Route | Model | Use Case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Fast | `qwen3:8b-q4_K_M` | Plan analysis, revision strategy, buddy chat |
| Reasoning | `qwen3:8b-q4_K_M` | Complex multi-step plan generation |
| Embeddings | `nomic-embed-text` | RAG document similarity search |

### Why qwen3:8b-q4_K_M is Used

| Requirement | qwen3:8b-q4_K_M Capability |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| JSON Output | Native instruction following |
| Context Window | 8192+ tokens |
| Reasoning | Strong for educational Q&A |
| Latency | Sub-30s on RTX 5060 8GB |
| Memory | Fits in 8GB VRAM (quantized) |
| Think Mode | Supports `/think` for extended reasoning |

### Performance Optimization: Thinking Mode Control

The `_call_ollama()` service accepts a `think` parameter. Thinking mode is **selectively disabled** (`think=False`) on latency-critical endpoints to avoid 3+ minute response times:

| Endpoint | Thinking | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Plan Analysis (`analyze_plan`) | Disabled | Uses fast model; thinking would add 3+ min |
| Revision Strategy | Disabled | User-facing, needs fast response |
| Study Buddy Chat | Disabled | Conversational, requires low latency |
| Profile Intelligence | Disabled | Chat interface, direct response needed |

### Why AI Runs Locally

1. **Privacy** - Academic transcripts and study materials never leave the user's machine
2. **Offline Support** - Functions without internet connectivity
3. **Cost** - No per-token API charges
4. **Predictability** - Consistent latency without network variables

### How Hallucinations are Minimized

- All prompts include explicit instructions to use only provided context
- Large inputs are truncated to prevent context confusion
- Low temperature (0.3-0.4) reduces randomness
- Strict JSON output schemas constrain responses
- Fallback defaults are returned when AI output fails parsing

### How Evaluation Works

The evaluation system uses AI for semantic grading:
1. User answers and correct answers are sent to the LLM
2. The model compares meaning, not exact strings
3. Scores are assigned based on question type (MCQ: binary, Short: 0-2, Long: 0-5)
4. Constructive feedback is generated for each question

### Why Antigravity is NOT Part of Runtime

Antigravity (external AI service) was used only for generating project documentation (this README and System Design). It is explicitly excluded from runtime to maintain the privacy guarantee.

}
```

The `keep_alive: 0` setting ensures the model is unloaded from GPU memory after each response. The `think: False` flag skips Qwen3's extended reasoning chain, reducing response time from 3+ minutes to ~30 seconds on structured tasks.

### Documentation Generation

This README and the System Design document were generated using Antigravity (external AI). Antigravity is not used in runtime.

## 15. Security and Privacy

### Authentication

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWTs signed with HS256
- Tokens expire after 24 hours by default
- OAuth support for Google and GitHub

### Data Privacy

- All AI inference happens locally via Ollama
- No academic data transmitted to external services
- Database runs in local Docker container
- User data is isolated by user_id in all queries

### Self-Test Answer Protection

1. In Self-Test mode, correct answers are stored server-side only
2. The client never receives correct answers before evaluation
3. Session IDs are UUIDs (cryptographically random)
4. Answers are deleted from memory after single evaluation

---

## 16. Testing and Verification

### Backend Testing

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

### Frontend Testing

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Manual Verification

1. Register a new account at `/register`
2. Complete onboarding flow
3. Navigate to Revision tab
4. Upload a study document
5. Click "Practice" on a topic
6. Select "Self-Test" mode
7. Verify answers are not visible before submission
8. Submit answers and verify evaluation feedback

## 17. Limitations

### AI Limitations

- Questions are based only on provided materials; no external knowledge
- Long documents are truncated to fit context window
- Evaluation is semantic but not authoritative
- Response quality depends on input clarity

### Technical Limitations

- Self-test sessions are lost on server restart (in-memory store)
- Single Ollama instance limits concurrent AI requests
- No real-time collaboration
- No mobile native apps

### Scope Limitations

- Does not integrate with university systems
- Does not provide proctored examinations
- Not a replacement for professional academic advising
- Not a mental health service
